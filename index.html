      <p>Saurabh Saxena is one of the most wonderful techy I have met. He is what you would call as an ideal techy co-founder. His raw intelligence, calm demeanor and positive outlook towards any tough tasks are his great strengths. His attention to details is exemplary and his umpteen numbers of ways to solve any given problem leaves me awestruck every time I meet with him. He breaks down the software development process amazingly well by creating milestone based tracking method for modules and tasks. His eagerness to understand, learn and contribute to the project is so high that he could be easily considered as the most important person in the project. His ability to communicate with both technical & non-technical people in a way that they truly understand is a strength very few possess. He is the guy you want besides you when you are pitching your idea to the investors.</p>

      Over the course of last 6 months, I have had the pleasure of working with Saurabh, who has been one of the key individual leading to SpotSoon success. 
      <br><br>

      Firstly, his tech knowledge is commendable ,  he picked up our challenges and started helping us with solutions at a fantastic rate (including minor aspects of the tool/platforms). This is essential when fielding questions from various verticals about the company, product and the technology that is currently being built around it. 
      <br>

      His attention to detail on the platforms is spot on when disseminating information to members of our team. This is a rare quality that can aid the company greatly. <br><br>

      Saurabh has also encouraged in our sales and company's vision and further discussions with the questions he brings in during our meetings - these questions bring in a fresh perspective of the existing infrasturture, business model and how we can improve them. 
      <br>

      Weâ€™re extremely glad to have someone with the wealth of knowledge that Saurabh possesses. His awesome skills have greatly assisted in fine tuning SpotSoon's growth. <br>

      He is a great mentor to have around!!!

      <p>
      I have had the distinguished pleasure of working with Saurabh Saxena, who is our tech advisor and more importantly a great friend!<br>


      We have had endless calls and meetings together, which has given me great understanding into the very strong work ethics that Saurabh brings to the table, and subsequently, SpotSoon <br>


      To say that Saurabh is talented would be a gross understatement.<br>


      With regard to SpotSoon, he is extremely professional with his subject matter and the infrastructure that he is currently overseeing. Saurabh has helped us hire great developers, who are the now the pillars in building SpotSoon<br>



      One of Saurabh best attributes is his ability to grasp the company strength and challenges. With just snippets of information, he is capable of formulating a plan and seeing it till successful execution. <br>


      I can proudly say that I have learned to emulate some very essential qualities that Saurabh displayed, who I am sure, will aid me in building SpotSoon! <br>


      I wish him absolute best and would like to say a very big THANK YOU

It is not easy to live this guy's life. Im pretty amazed about how much he is excited about contributing values to other people's life especially in the startup communities. Technically, you know programmatically, he is not just a genius, he is a saint. Good thing is, even if you dont know this guy, just call him, you will get your problems solved! Happy about your rapid growth and wish you all best things in life, dude!!"</p>
